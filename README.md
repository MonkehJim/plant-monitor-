# plantmonitor
College independent project. Using GrowHAT to monitor soil moisture and automatically update a google sheet to represent this data to a wider audience.

My aims for the project are:
- Monitor the soil moisture content of 3 separate plants 🌱🌱🌱
- Automatically update a Google Sheet with the readings from the monitor 🌐
- Create an easy-to-understand graph 📈
